# PR laboratory No.1
## Kitchen

This is the dinning hall part of Restaurant simulation of the first laboratory work at Network programming course.
The dinning hall part: https://github.com/AnnDv/PR_Hall
## Main Task

The purpose of this task is to write a somewhat realistic simulation of how a restaurant works.
    
The general idea is that there is *The Dining hall* and *Kitchen*.
The *Dinning Hall* generates *orders* and gives it to the *Kitchen* which prepares them and returns prepared orders back to the *Dinning Hall*
